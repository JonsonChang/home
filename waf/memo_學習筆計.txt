3.3.3. More build commands
The following commands all use the same function build from the wscript file:
    build: process the source code to create the object files
    clean: remove the object files that were created during a build (unlike distclean, do not remove the configuration)
    install: check that all object files have been generated and copy them on the system (programs, libraries, data files, etc)
    uninstall: undo the installation, remove the object files from the system without touching the ones in the build directory
    list: list the task generators in the build section (to use with waf --targets=name)
    step: force the rebuild of particular files for debugging purposes
